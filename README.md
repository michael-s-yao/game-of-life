# Game of Life (Java)

This coding exercise is designed for students to practice matrix manipulation, for and while loops, conditional statements, and abstraction in Java. The ```src``` directory contains the template code for the student: only ```GameOfLife.java``` needs to be modified. The ```sol``` directory contains example solution code.

A description of the purpose and functionality of this code can be found [here](http://michaelsyao.com/java/game-of-life/index.html).
